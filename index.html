      <h3>Questions?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><h4> you looking for solutions to exercises and problems in Introduction to Algorithms?</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>As of the third edition, we are making available solutions for a select set of exercises and problems. They are posted at the MIT Press website.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><h4>What is the difference between an edition and a printing?</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>We have also produced an Instructor's Manual, which is available only to instructors who have adopted the book for course use. The manual has lecture notes and solutions to additional exercises and problems, but by no means all of them. (I estimate that writing up solutions to all exercises and problems would take somewhere between 2000 and 3000 pages.) You'll need to contact the MIT Press for passwords to access the manual site and the files. (Contact information is at the MIT Press website.) You cannot get the passwords from me or from any of my coauthors</li>

        <li><h4>Can I get solutions to exercises and problems?</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Each edition is a major ☆★<a href="hobbies.html" target="_blank">revision</a> of the book. The first edition of Introduction to Algorithms was published in 1990, the second edition came out in 2001, the third edition appeared in 2009, and the fourth edition is from 2022. A printing for a given edition occurs when the publisher needs to manufacture more copies. As the answer to the previous question indicates, we have been correcting errors in each printing of the second and third editions. We perturb the pagination as little as possible when correcting errors for a new printing.</li>
